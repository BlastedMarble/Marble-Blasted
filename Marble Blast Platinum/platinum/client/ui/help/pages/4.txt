Main Menu Interface

The Main Menu is composed of seven buttons:
-	The Play button allows you to play Marble Blast Gold, Platinum, Ultra, and PlatinumQuest offline, as well as custom levels which you can download at MarbleBlast.com
-	The Online button allows you to play all these levels online, where your performance is rated on a global leaderboard. You can also play a competitive Gem Hunt mode with other players, or a co-operative mode where you try to beat the single-player levels as a team
-	The Options button allows you to configure many basic options in Marble Blast Platinum to suit your liking
-	The Quit button to quit the game. Don't press it :)
-	The Tip of the Day button, which provides news and updates or just tips. Disclaimer: does not actually provide a tip on a daily basis.
-	The Replay Center button allows you an easy access to all recordings you or other users have done in Marble Blast.
-	The Help button, which leads you here. Not to this page, no, but the first one.
